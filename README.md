# OBPI — Ontology for Building Permit–Relevant Inspections

The Ontology for Building Permit–Relevant Inspections (OBPI) provides a formal vocabulary to model, plan, execute, and evaluate inspections that are carried out by or on behalf of building authorities after a permit is issued. OBPI represents inspection plans, responsibilities, timing and frequency, procedures and equipment, documentation and certificates, as well as inspection‐related costs and outcomes. It is accompanied by a SHACL rule module to support rule-based decision support and semi-automated inference for inspection planning and evaluation.

## Description
OBPI integrates permit, inspection, and construction-process knowledge into a shared, machine-interpretable model. It reuses and aligns concepts from related ontologies (e.g., OBPA for building authorities, OCQA for inspection planning, and DiCon for construction processes) and connects inspection instances to heterogeneous project information (BIM, schedules, organizational data). The ontology’s SHACL rules capture regulatory and expert knowledge so that inspection necessity, timing/frequency, scope, responsibilities, procedure/equipment, and documentation requirements can be derived consistently across jurisdictions and trades.
